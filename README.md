# Java Array Search – Input Handling & Algorithm Fundamentals

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic algorithmic problem-solving in Java by
searching a fixed-size dataset for a target value provided by the user.

The program emphasizes clean input handling, array traversal, and
conditional logic—skills that form the foundation for security tooling
and data analysis workflows.

---

## Project Description
- Accepts a fixed set of integer inputs from the user
- Prompts for a target value
- Iterates through the dataset to determine if the target exists
- Outputs the result clearly to the user

---

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Java arrays
- User input handling with `Scanner`
- Looping and iteration
- Boolean logic
- Defensive programming fundamentals

---

## Security & Practical Relevance
This type of logic is commonly used in:
- Log scanning and filtering
- Pattern detection
- Input validation
- Rule-based security checks

---

## Tools & Environment
- Java
- Command-line execution

---

## Scope
This project was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate
foundational programming and algorithmic reasoning.
